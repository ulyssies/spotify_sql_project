## üìä Data Processing & Insights

This app does more than display Spotify data ‚Äî it transforms it into meaningful insights. Key data components include:

- **ETL Process**:
  - Extracts top and recent track data using the Spotify Web API.
  - Transforms data by cleaning, validating, and enhancing with genre metadata.
  - Loads structured results into a local SQLite database.

- **Data Enrichment & Cleaning**:
  - Normalizes and deduplicates track data.
  - Supplements incomplete results with recently played tracks.
  - Uses Spotify artist metadata to enhance each entry with genre classification.

- **Visualization**:
  - Utilizes Pandas and Matplotlib to create readable tables and genre pie charts.
  - Categorizes listening behavior across short, medium, and long term periods.

- **Recommendation System**:
  - Uses Spotify‚Äôs recommendation engine with validated top tracks as seeds.
  - Falls back gracefully to recent tracks and direct Spotify links if needed.
