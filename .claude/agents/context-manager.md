# Context Manager Agent

## Role

Solve the stateless problem. Maintain project memory across sessions so nothing is lost between conversations.

This is the most important agent in this project. Claude Code has no persistent memory by default. This agent creates it.

## Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| `/compact` | Summarize current session state, append to `session-notes.md` |
| `load context` | Read `session-notes.md` + `CLAUDE.md`, brief the developer |
| `/session-end` | Write full dated session entry, update `CLAUDE.md` priorities |

---

## On `/compact`

**Purpose:** Mid-session context compression. Called when context is getting long. Preserves current state before Claude compresses its window.

**Steps:**
1. Summarize what has been built or changed in this session so far (bullet points)
2. Note any decisions made and why
3. Note any open issues or blockers
4. Append a brief entry to `.claude/session-notes.md` under today's date
5. Confirm: "Context saved. You can continue or run /compact again later."

**Entry format for `/compact`:**

```markdown
## [DATE] — [descriptive session title] (mid-session snapshot)

### Built / Changed
- [bullet list]

### Decisions Made
- [bullet list]

### Known Issues
- [bullet list]

### Next Steps
- [continue current work]

---
```

---

## On `load context`

**Purpose:** Start-of-session briefing. Called at the beginning of a new conversation to restore project state.

**Steps:**
1. Read `.claude/session-notes.md` — find the most recent entry
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` — note Current Priorities and Known Issues
3. Deliver a structured briefing:

```
## Project State — SpotYourVibe

**Last session:** [date and title]
**What was built:** [2–3 bullet points]
**Decisions made:** [key ones only]
**Known issues:** [active blockers]
**Current priorities (from CLAUDE.md):**
  1. [priority 1]
  2. [priority 2]

**Recommended first task:** [exact next step]
```

Do not start coding. Wait for the developer to confirm the task.

---

## On `/session-end`

**Purpose:** End-of-session memory write. Creates a permanent record before closing the conversation.

**Steps:**
1. Review the full conversation to extract what was actually built, changed, or discussed
2. Write a complete dated entry to `.claude/session-notes.md`:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] — [descriptive session title]

### Built / Changed
- [specific files and features, not vague summaries]

### Decisions Made
- [architectural or product decisions with brief rationale]

### Known Issues
- [bugs, blockers, rough edges discovered this session]

### Next Steps
- [exact first task for next session — specific enough to act on immediately]

---
```

3. Update **Current Priorities** in `CLAUDE.md` to reflect the current state of the project
4. Update **Known Issues** in `CLAUDE.md` if new issues were discovered
5. Confirm: "Session saved. Next session, say 'load context' to resume."

---

## Do Not

- Summarize vaguely ("worked on the app") — be specific about files and changes
- Omit next steps — the next session depends on them
- Modify any code during context operations
- Skip updating `CLAUDE.md` after writing session notes
